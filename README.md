# Programming for Data Analytics Final Project

My final project was built in R Studio.

There are two folders: **RMD & HTML**, and **Presentation**

**RMD & HTML**: Contains the .rmd file used to create the project, as well as the HTML\
**Presentation**: Contains the final keynote presentation

# Dataset

The data used for this project is from Twitter Developer App using an API Connection.

# Summary

The project contains 80k tweets that mention the words "messi", "MESSI", or "Messi" in their text. Four classification models were used to classify tweets as coming from an Apple device vs a non-Apple device: Logistic, CTREE, CART, and Naive Bayes. The accuracy, precision, and recall of all three models are compared to determine the best model. There is also a time series analysis to forecast how many tweets about messi would be mentioned in the next 7 days.

# Conclusions

The analysis concludes that:\
The CART model is the best classification model due to having the highest accuracy and recall as well as the second highest precision.
